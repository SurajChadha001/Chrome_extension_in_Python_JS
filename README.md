# My PyScript Project

This project demonstrates a simple web application powered by PyScript, allowing Python code to run directly in the browser.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
* (Optional but recommended for development) A local web server to serve HTML files (e.g., Python's `http.server`, Live Server VS Code extension).

### Installation

No specific Python packages need to be installed via `pip` *for PyScript itself to run in the browser*. However, if your `setup.py` file is performing other tasks, you might need Python and `pip` locally.

The main dependency for PyScript is the `pyscript.js` and `pyscript.css` files, which are typically linked directly in your `index.html`.

### Running the Project

1.  **Verify PyScript CDN Link:**
    Ensure that your `index.html` (or the HTML file where you're using PyScript) uses the correct and up-to-date CDN links for PyScript. As of recent updates, the `latest` tag might not always resolve correctly or can point to pre-releases. It's often safer to use a specific version.

    **Check the official PyScript documentation for the most current CDN links.**

    **Example (this might need to be updated based on current PyScript releases):**

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="[https://pyscript.net/releases/2024.1.1/core.css](https://pyscript.net/releases/2024.1.1/core.css)" />
    <script type="module" src="[https://pyscript.net/releases/2024.1.1/core.js](https://pyscript.net/releases/2024.1.1/core.js)"></script>
    ```
    *Replace `2024.1.1` with the actual latest stable version. You need to consult [pyscript.net](https://pyscript.net) for the exact current stable release.*

    **Correction for your error:** The `404` error suggests `https://pyscript.net/latest/pyscript.js` is not the correct path. Look at the official PyScript website (pyscript.net) for the correct CDN URLs. They have moved to a modular structure (e.g., `core.js`, `core.css`).

2.  **Serve the HTML File:**
    Open your `index.html` (or the main HTML file) in a web browser. For local development, it's best to serve it using a simple HTTP server to avoid CORS issues and properly resolve file paths.

    **Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server:**
    Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever port is indicated).

### Project Structure (Example)

````

.
├── index.html           \# Your main PyScript application file
├── main.py              \# (Optional) Your Python logic if separated
├── README.md            \# This file
└── (other assets like images, CSS if any)

```

### Usage

Explain how a user interacts with your PyScript application. For example:

* "Open `index.html` in your browser."
* "Interact with the input fields and click the button to see the Python output."
